This was tested and sent by me a while ago, resending this as I might have just shared this Jay and Shaun.

Meraki devices cannot be SNMP polled from outside the Meraki Cloud Network by default, however, configured an existing Meraki directly to provide SNMP info to our SNMP server.
Once SNMP was enabled on the Meraki and Security Appliance services IP’s whitelisted, was able to send SNMP requests and extract info from the Meraki.

Works with MX64, 84 and 100 which we will be using.

Alerting Options from the Meraki can be done directly to the customer and via GCOMM router alerts
